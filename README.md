# Computer-Vision
This Repository contains all the computer vision projects that I have undertaken. Initially I was against the idea of trying my hand at deep learning or even implement the concepts that I had gone through during the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). Eventually I started doing the [two courses by Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/) who is undoubtedly an exceptional educator. His top down approach helped me finally code in it and produce decent models.
